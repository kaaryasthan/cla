# Contributor License Agreement

By signing [Kaaryasthan contributor license agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/kaaryasthan/contributor-license-agreement) (CLA), you
confirm that:

1. Anyone can use your contributions anywhere, for free, forever.
2. Your contributions do not infringe on anyone else's rights.


The contributor license agreement gives project maintainers assurances
about where contributions are coming from and what rights are being
granted along with them.

**[Read the Agreement](CLA.md)**

### Why do you have to sign the contributor license agreement when contributing to Kaaryasthan project that is already under an open source license?

Open source licenses serve as implicit contributor agreements.  A
formal contributor license agreement makes contribution terms explicit
and provides the project maintainers a record of your agreement to
those terms.

Kaaryasthan project is released under the AGPL v3+ license, which
grants permission to use but does not expressly reference copyright or
patent.  The contributor license agreement expressly secures copyright
and patent grants from you.

When making your first pull request to a Kaaryasthan project, we want
you to fully understand the permissions you are granting and make sure
you have the rights needed to do so.

### What is special about this contributor license agreement?
